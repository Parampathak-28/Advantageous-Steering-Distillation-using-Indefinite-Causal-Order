# Advantageous-Steering-Distillation-using-Indefinite-Causal-Order 
• In this project of QIntern: Advantageous Steering Distillation using Indefinite Causal Order, my contributions
revolved around utilizing Mathematica to conduct comprehensive research and implement crucial
components. I was responsible for the creation of bipartite states, a fundamental element in the
investigation.
• Additionally, I executed various quantum operations on these states, particularly coherent controlled
distillation operations, as part of the distillation protocol.
• Using Mathematica, I meticulously assessed the fidelity of the protocol's output, comparing scenarios
with and without indefinite causal order.
